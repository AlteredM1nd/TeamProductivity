# Team Productivity
A series of scripts designed to extract data from an Excel workbook and turn it into usable data for Power BI. The purpose of these scripts is to calculate productivity metrics for a team of employees, extracting the data from dated sheets which store one day's worth of work tasks and non-entry related tasks for each team member and creating a table of that information, which can then be fed into Power BI for analysis, and the TeamProductivity.bas script will generate a dashboard of the weekly and monthly productivity metrics for the team.

## TeamProductivity.bas
This script generates a dashboard that shows productivity metrics for the team. It will extract data from the Output and OutputNE sheets and display them in a dashboard. The dashboard will show the following metrics:
- Total productive hours for each team member
- Total non-entry hours for each team member
- Total productive hours for the team
- Total non-entry hours for the team
- Total productive hours for the team
- Total non-entry hours for the team
