## Setup Instructions

1. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Ensure you have two worksheets in your workbook:
     - `Output`: Contains daily work entries with columns for date, name, and hours
     - `OutputNE`: Contains non-entry related tasks with similar structure

2. **Import the Macro**
   - Open the VBA Editor (Alt + F11)
   - Import the `TeamProductivity.bas` module
   - Save the workbook as a macro-enabled workbook (.xlsm)

3. **Run the Macro**
   - Press `Alt + F8`, select `CalculateProductivityMetrics`, and click "Run"
   - Or assign the macro to a button for one-click access

## Output
After running the macro, two new worksheets will be created/updated:

1. **ProductivityDashboard**
   - Left side: Weekly productivity metrics
   - Right side: Monthly productivity metrics
   - Automatic formatting and calculations

2. **MonthlyBreakdown**
   - Detailed view of each team member's monthly performance
   - Sorted chronologically by month and alphabetically by name
   - Visual indicators for at-a-glance performance assessment

## Usage Notes
- The macro automatically detects and processes all available data
- Weekly target: 32.5 hours per team member
- Monthly target: 140 hours per team member (32.5 hours/week Ã— 4.3 weeks)
- The dashboard updates the "Last Updated" timestamp automatically

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing Worksheets**: Ensure both `Output` and `OutputNE` worksheets exist
- **Macro Not Running**: Check Excel's macro security settings and enable macros
- **Incorrect Data**: Verify that date and hour columns contain valid data
